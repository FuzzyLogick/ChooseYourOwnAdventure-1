#I transcribed this story to help me with developing my "muscle memory" in Python.  I am still learning, so please excuse much of the 
#delivery.  As my Python improves, I will revisit this and update accordingly.  

#As for the story, it is based on a Choose Your Own Adventure written by Roy Wandelmaier and published by Troll Communications in 1985.  
#If you can find a copy of this book, I suggest you  snag it.  It had provided me hours of enjoyment as a child, and as a result, 
#much of the book is dog-eared, faded, and generally falling apart.  The thought of losing this book to time really concerned me, so 
#that was another strong reason for me to transcribe it into a Python game.  There are illustrations in this book.  I have messed around with 
#converting it to ascii, but the results have been less than appetizing.  When I figure out a better way of showing art, I will incorporate it
#into the code.

#I do not claim to own the rights to this story, they belong to the publisher.


#To run, just simply ./SecretsOfTheOldMuseum.py

#This game is built using Python3
