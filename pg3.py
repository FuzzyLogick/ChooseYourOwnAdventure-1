    print("You enter the Hall of Ancient Egypt.  There are only a few other visitors today - a group of seven men and women, all dressed in long, white, flowing robes.  They are looking at a reconstructed temple.  What interests you the most is the new exhibit being set up in a nearby room.  Workers are unpacking cases which which have just arrived from an archaeological dig.  Suddenly a crate crashes to the ground, and the contents spill all over the floor.  As the workers scramble to retrieve the artifacts, a small bottle rolls under the partition and rests against your shoe.  You pick up the bottle.  The bottle is very old, but it still seems to be full of liquid.  It is covered with hieroglyphics, the picture writing of the ancient Egyptians.  The workers are so busy trying to clean up, they don't notice you have the bottle.  But the seven men and women in white robes have moved closer to you while you weren't looking. Did they see you pick up the bottle?  Something tells you to hide it in your pocket.  You leave the room, but the seven people do not seem to notice you.  You walk quickly down a hallway and enter the planetarium to have another look at your find, this time in private.")
