You are cornered and have no choice.  You hand over the bottle to them, but they stab you anyway.  All three of them repeatedly stab you all over your body, face, neck and back.  After the fury, you are left on the cool tile floor bleeding.  You have a hard time breathing, and cannot take a full breath.  The last thing you notice is the smell of copper getting stronger.  No one helps you and you die there on that floor.  Your body isn't discovered until later that evening.  Your attackers are never caught.")
