    print("Meerang gives you great laser firepower.  But you find you need more than that.  You never even get close enough to find their lair before the Mangons smell you.  In the battle, you kill many Mangons.  But they are finally too much for you.  You are surrounded.  Out of supplies and your laser pistols no longer working, you reach into your satchel to remove a hand grenade you've removed from the body of a dead Mangon.  Unable to figure out how to detonate the alien-explosive, you are quickly tackled and captured.  They have plans for you...")
    print("They start with Vleet first.  You and Nisko are made to watch.  Several of the Mangon hold Vleet's body as one stands above him with a knife.  The one weilding the knife kneels down beside Vleet's head and whispers something only he can hear.  Vleet begings to whimper and cry... It doesn't change his captor's mind and he plunges the blade of the knife into Vleet's neck.  Gurgling sounds can be heard, punctuated by sharp, high-pitched shrill screams.  Blood, copious amounts of it pour from the neck.  His body, going spastic and desperately flailing in any direction for escape, controlled only by the hands of the Mangon.  After what seems to be an eternity, Vleet's body becomes limp, and all movement stops.  The Mangon have a hard time cutting beyond the spinal cord, and now use the blade in a chopping motion.  The sickening thump, thump, thump sound makes you want to vomit.  You can actually feel the sounds reverberate through the air.  Nisko sits speechless in a pool of his own urine.  After a few seconds of chopping and twisting, the blade of the knife successfully severs Vleet's head.  The grotesque, twisted expression on Vleet's face was a reminder of where you were at, and why this was happening to you.  Vleet's head is tossed to the side and unceremoniously rolls down the small hill.  Several of the Mangon take turns kicking it back and fourth.")

    print("They next come for Nisco.  As the two Mongon hoist Nisco from his urine, a last second realization bolts into his mind and he breaks free from their grasp and runs.  One of the Mongon was able to catch up and slashes the back of his legs, severing several of his tendons.  Nisco falls face forward and the Mongon surround him.  This time, they go quickly to work.  You cannot directly see what is happening, only hearing the same helpless shrill Vleet gave out moments ago.  You see no blood, only the frantic flailing of arms and legs.  There is laughter interspersed during the screaming.  The laughter is not coming from Nisco.  They are doing something to him, but you don't know what. The crowd stands up and steps back.  You can slightly make out what happened but none of it makes sense.  Nisco is alive and crawling on his hands and knees, but he isn't getting away.  He isn't making any attempt to escape.  He is just kneeling there, swiping his hand infront of him, over and over.  You notice what appears to be two, dull-white hard boiled eggs to the side of him, and it occurred to what had happened.  The black, empty cavaties are the only thing you can now see as Nisco helplessly searches for a way out of the darkness.  The Mongon, still without mercy, leave Nisco alone.  They know when night falls, the animals that inhabit the forest will be more merciful.")

    print("The Mongon, growing weary of their broken playtoy turn to you.  You attemt to bargin with them, and finally beg for your release.  The one responsible for Vleet's beheadding approaches you, calmly.  He explains that the Mongon have the ability to measure your pain and fear, and that they will take their time with you.  He explains they plan on making you last much longer than the previous two.  He tells you what they will be doing to you, but you do not hear any of it.  You only stare helplessly at the elongated object in his hand.")
